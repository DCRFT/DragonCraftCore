# DragonCraftCore
DragonCraftCore is a <i>core</i> plugin. It provides common features for a survival Minecraft server.
Intended to use <b>only</b> with DragonCraft (DCRFT.PL) Minecraft server. Probably useless on other servers. We're trying to make it easy-to-use for every server, but our focus is DragonCraft.
